# StoryCardMaker

Randomly generate story cards from Jessica Abel and Matt Madden's book "Drawing Words &amp; Writing Pictures."  
Inspired by Jessica Abel and Sarah Von Bargen's discussion of creative habits, and the idea of needing "a bookmark habit", this application is designed to let you use the index cards even if you left your physical copy at home.

If you want to add additonal occupations, personality traits, physical traits, and/or story sparks just edit the related text files.

I'm an artist not a programmer, so if you want to help continue improving this code, please have at, just please share!
